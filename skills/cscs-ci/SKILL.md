## What CSCS CI is

CSCS use GitLab CI through a middleware (`cicd-ext-mw.cscs.ch`). GitHub
repositories are registered with CSCS; a webhook pushes a mirror to GitLab and
pipelines run there. GitHub check-run `details_url`s point to the CSCS viewer,
not to GitLab directly. Status is posted back to GitHub as check runs/statuses.

CI status names on GitHub follow the format `cscs/<pipeline_name>` (e.g.
`cscs/default`, `cscs/distributed`). This is how CSCS pipelines appear in
`gh pr checks` output and the GitHub PR UI.

CI may trigger automatically on push or PR events depending on how the
project is configured (CI-enabled branches and trusted users, set on the
CSCS CI setup page). This is project-specific. If it is not explicitly
stated for the current project, ask the user before assuming CI will run
or won't run on its own.

## `cscs-ci run` is NOT a shell command

This is a **PR comment** posted on GitHub to trigger a specific
pipeline. Do not try to run it in a shell.

Syntax:
- `cscs-ci run`: triggers the single (default) pipeline
- `cscs-ci run PIPELINE_NAME`: triggers a named pipeline
- `cscs-ci run PIPELINE_1,PIPELINE_2`: multiple pipelines, comma-separated
- `cscs-ci run PIPELINE;VAR=value;VAR2=value2`: injects variables as
  environment variables into the pipeline

Rules:
- Disallowed characters in pipeline name, variable name, and variable value:
  `,;=` (they serve as separators between components)
- Only the first line of the comment is evaluated; lines 2+ are free context
- Only works if the commenting user is in the pipeline's trusted users list
- The target branch is ignored; you can trigger a pipeline even if the
  target branch is not in the pipeline's CI-enabled branches

## Fetching logs

### The `&type=gitlab` gotcha

GitHub check-run `details_url`s for CSCS CI end in `&type=gitlab`. This
forces an OAuth login and cannot be fetched by text-mode tools. **Always
strip `&type=gitlab` from the URL first.**

### CSCS viewer URLs

Pipeline result page (without `&type=gitlab`):
```
https://cicd-ext-mw.cscs.ch/ci/pipeline/results/{namespace}/{project_id}/{pipeline_id}?iid={pr_id}
```
This static HTML page contains the job list. Per-job result pages:
```
https://cicd-ext-mw.cscs.ch/ci/job/result/{namespace}/{project_id}/{job_id}?iid={pr_id}
```

### GitLab raw traces

The GitLab API endpoints `/jobs/{id}` and `/jobs/{id}/trace` require
authentication and return 401 even for public projects. Use the raw trace
endpoint instead. It is publicly accessible:
```
https://gitlab.com/{encoded-path}/-/jobs/{id}/raw
```
Encode the project path: replace `/` with `%2F`. Do not conclude auth is
required before trying `/raw`.

### Download procedure

CI logs can be large (100k+ lines). Never fetch full logs into context.  Always
download to a temp file and grep:

```bash
LOGFILE=$(mktemp /tmp/cscs-log.XXXXXX.log)
curl -sL "<stripped-url>" -o "$LOGFILE"
wc -l "$LOGFILE"
```

If the fetched page is empty (traces are sometimes JavaScript-loaded), ask
the user to manually export the log from the CSCS viewer and provide the
file path.

## CSCS CI-specific pitfalls

These differ from standard GitLab CI:

- `CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE` is always `trigger`, never `push` or
  `merge_request` or any other value from GitLab's predefined variables.
- `rules: changes` will not work; pipelines are always triggered via the
  middleware, never as branch or merge request pipelines.
- `only`/`except` and `rules` can restrict jobs to specific branches, but
  a pipeline is only triggered if it matches the rules defined on the
  repository's CI setup page (not just the YAML).
- Trigger jobs for child pipelines must use
  `trigger: forward: pipeline_variables: true` to propagate parent
  variables. Without this, child pipelines will not receive variables like
  `CSCS_CI_MW_URL`.

## Key CI variables

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CSCS_CI_MW_URL` | `https://cicd-ext-mw.cscs.ch/ci` | |
| `CSCS_REGISTRY` | `jfrog.svc.cscs.ch` | Internal container registry |
| `CSCS_REGISTRY_PATH` | `jfrog.svc.cscs.ch/docker-ci-ext/<repository-id>` | Write path in registry; images under `**/public/**` are pullable by anyone on CSCS network |
| `CSCS_CI_DEFAULT_SLURM_ACCOUNT` | Configured on CI setup page | Default Slurm account; overridable per-job via `SLURM_ACCOUNT` |
| `CSCS_CI_ORIG_CLONE_URL` | HTTPS (public) or SSH (private) | Clone URL of the registered project, not the mirror |
| `ARCH` | `x86_64` or `aarch64` | |

## Runner types

Runners are referenced by including the CSCS config:
```yaml
include:
  - remote: 'https://gitlab.com/cscs-ci/recipes/-/raw/master/templates/v2/.ci-ext.yml'
```

Runner naming: `.<type>-<cluster>-<microarchitecture>` (e.g.
`.container-runner-daint-gh200`). The cluster and microarchitecture
determine which hardware the job runs on.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `container-builder` | Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile, pushes to registry. No Slurm. |
| `container-runner` | Runs a container image via Slurm/FirecREST. For GPU/MPI workloads. |
| `container-runner-lightweight` | No Slurm, faster start. Max 60 min, 4 CPUs, 4GB. Public images only. |
| `uenv-builder` | Builds a uenv (unified environment) from recipe YAML. |
| `uenv-runner` | Runs with a uenv image mounted (not inside a container). Via Slurm. |
| `baremetal-runner` | Almost equivalent to a Slurm sbatch script. No container. |
| `f7t-controller` | FirecREST controller for job submission. |
| `reframe-runner` | Runs ReFrame regression tests. |
